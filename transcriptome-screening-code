#The following scripts were run on the University of Michigan's high performance computing cluster.
#Briefly, raw transcriptomes were downloaded from SRA using the sratoolkit, filtered for quality using fastxtoolkit, and converted to fasta format. Single-end reads were assembled with Trinity, ORFs predicted with Transdecoder, and the ORFs searched for homology with RdRPs using hmmscan. 
#The RdRP profile was made as follows.....(fill in here)
